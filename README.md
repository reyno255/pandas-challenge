This code produces several cross-sections of video game purchase data sliced to display
purchase amounts, trends and quantities by item, gender, age and user.

The goal is to break down the large data set into meaningful results, uncovering trends 
and explain sales.

# Trend Observations

Three observations:

1. Video Game Players are overwhelmingly male - 84% - and as a result account for the majority of purchases and dollars spent.

2. 76.74% of all Video Game Players fall in the 15-29 age bracket.  45% fall within the 20-24% age bracket. 
   This would indicate that the primary age bracket falls around college aged players. The broader category being High School to Young adults making up 3/4 of all      players.

3. The Avg Total Purchase per Person ticks up between ages 30-39 and is relatively high for the 20-24 range.  
   Indicating that college age players are spending, on average as much as players who we assume are more established financially.
